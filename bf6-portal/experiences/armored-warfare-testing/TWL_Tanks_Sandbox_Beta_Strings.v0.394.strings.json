        "tip4": "We are limited by the inability to change vehicle loadouts mid-game:\n - Your loadout is locked once in-game; reconnect to choose a different vehicle loadout.\n - You can change your Engineer sub-class (Combat Engineer is optimal).\n - Vehicle performance and damage modeling is unchanged from vanilla BF6.",
        "tip5": "Positioning at the round start is up to the players:\n - The opening moments of a round are impactful!\n - Position intelligently at the start to flank, or setup ambushes.\n - If you cross the main base thresholds before countdown ends, return to the main base.",

        "tip8": "The captain goes down with his ship:\n - Repairing your friends is allowed, as long as your vehicle is still standing.\n - If you lose your vehicle, please redeploy and let the round play out without you.\n - You can repair torch enemy vehicles but only as long as your own vehicle is still in play.",

        "tip11": "This Experience is in active development! If bugs occur...\n - Access the Admin Panel in the top right while the 'Ready Up' screen is visible.\n - The Admin panel has global audit messaging and admin action counts.\n - Opening or using the Admin panel gives a global notification for all to see.\n - If any Admin buttons are used, the victory dialog shows this for awareness / visibility.\n - The Admin panel is for fixing innocent mistakes only (avoid using it unless necessary).",
