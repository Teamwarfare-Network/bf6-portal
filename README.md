    - This vehicle registration is required to ensure accuracy of scoring
    - If you play a live round and notice improper kill records, adjust with the Admin panel (see below)
- Custom Portal experiences cannot edit vehicle loadouts once in-game. If needed, you should reconnect to reconfigure and then rejoin. 
    - Choose, select and activate your optimal/desired MBT, IFV and Engineer class loadouts before joining!
    - If you have issues spawning in, ensure your Engineer loadout just has supply crates and a melee weapon equipped and also ensure you are a Combat Engineer class
- If you die during a live round, please wait in your main base until the round finishes.
- If your tank blows up but you don't die, please redeploy to your main base (don't chase enemy tanks with your repair torch).
- Tanks play as they do in Vanilla BF6 right now, we are playtesting changes to health regen or considering loadout restritions. 
    - We and are open to feedback as we playtest possible balance changes/limitations

    - Players are shown as "In Main Base / Not In Main" or "Ready / Not Ready"

- Resupply your ammo crates at main base if needed
- Team swap via a single button with forced undeploy from Ready Up screen
- If you leave your main base early, a global notification is displayed, and any Round countdowns are ceased, to ensure map positioning is fair at round start

**Admin Panel**:
- This is an experience in active development, so when issues are discovered - the Admin panel can be used for adjusting round kills, total kills, round wins, ties, etc
- Admin Panel is accessed via a top right button while the Ready Up dialog is visible
- The Admin panel has global audit messaging and admin action counts 
    - Opening the Admin panel gives a global notification, while using the Admin panel buttons displays a message and increments an action counter
    - If any Admin buttons are used, the final victory dialog shows this for awareness/visibility to prevent malicious or sneaky scoreboard tweaks
