# TWL Tanks Only 2v2

Only tank kills count, compete in a curated competitive 2v2 tanks experience across 7 maps, with rounds and kills tracked in a custom HUD. Triple-tap the interact key to display the Ready up dialog. During combat you can leave your tank to repair (but stay close to it!) and you can use ammo crates for resupply. More ammo crates are given once returning to your main inbetween rounds.

Known limitations
- Cannot edit vehicle loadout once in-game. Reconnect to reconfigure and then rejoin. Tip: Choose and select your optimal/desired MBT, IFV and engineer class loadouts before joining.
- If you don't see a "Vehicle Registration" message pop up when entering your vehicle, get out and get back in
- If you have issues spawning in, ensure your loadout just has supply crates for engineer

Primary features
- Round-based, vehicle-only scoring; vehicles register to a team on first entry.
- Destroying a registered vehicle during a LIVE round awards the opposing team a round kill.
- Rounds end on 2 target kills or round timer expiry; match ends by best-of rounds (default best of 3).
- Ready Up dialog with roster, per-player ready state, and main-base gating.
- Team swap via a single button with forced undeploy.
- Admin panel for live tuning (round kills target, wins, ties, clock, round start/end), complete with auditing messages and admin action counts.
- HUD and victory/round-end dialogs mirror authoritative match state.
- Main-base entry/exit tracking with gadget ammo restock and pre-round "over-line" warnings.
