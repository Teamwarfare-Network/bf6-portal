# Vehicles Only Experiences Features:
This applies to Tanks Only, Helis Only, Jets Only Ladder experiences at TWL

**Primary Vehicles Only Features**:
- Round and Vehicle destruction based scoring - choose your experience configuration: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4
- Only Vehicle Kills count when the Round is Live (no infantry guns, weapons or gadgets)
- HUD displays Wins/Losses/Ties and Round/Total Kills with match time remaining
- Ready up in your main base -> wait for countdown -> fight 
    - Triple tap your interact keybind to access the Ready Up screen
- Automatic respawn/resets and Round win screens
- Automatic Map victory screen with match results summarized
- Main-base entry/exit tracking with gadget ammo restock and pre-round "over-line" warnings.
  
**Important / Known Limitations with Vehicles Only**:
- Custom Portal experiences cannot edit vehicle loadouts once in-game. If needed, you should reconnect to reconfigure and then rejoin. 
    - Choose, select and activate your optimal/desired vehicle and Engineer class loadouts before joining!
    - If there are multiple people playing, they can each bring different loadouts. Get in and move the vehicle to lock that loadout for another player.
- Vehicles play as they do in Vanilla BF6 right now
    - We and are open to feedback as we playtest possible balance changes/limitations!
    - Provide feedback in Discord to discuss with our community the optimal competitive configurations and rulesets

**Additional Vehicles Only Features**:
- Only the Engineer's repair torch and supply crates are allowed as gadgets
- You can repair your vehicle during combat, or drop a supply crate for ammo but don't stray too far
    - Vehicles are "abandoned" and slowly lose health if you get too far from them
- HUD Helper text to give context on Round state and player readiness
- Ready up screen to force all combatants to remain in the main base before Round begins
    - Players are shown as "In Main Base / Not In Main" or "Ready / Not Ready" 
    - Toggle maximum rounds, e.g. decide between "Best of 3 Rounds" or "Best of 7 Rounds", or any desired limit
- Resupply your ammo crates at main base if needed
- Team swap via a single button with forced undeploy from Ready Up screen
- If you leave your main base early or get too high in the air, a global notification is displayed to ensure map positioning is fair at round start

**Admin Panel**:
- This are experiences in active development, so when issues are discovered - the Admin panel can be used for adjusting round kills, total kills, round wins, ties, etc
- Admin Panel is accessed via a top right button while the Ready Up dialog is visible
- The Admin panel has global audit messaging and admin action counts 
    - Opening the Admin panel gives a global notification, while using the Admin panel buttons displays a message and increments an action counter
    - If any Admin buttons are used, the final victory dialog shows this for awareness/visibility to prevent malicious or sneaky scoreboard tweaks
