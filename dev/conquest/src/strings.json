        "mandatory1": "IMPORTANT: to start the game...\n - While on foot: stand still! Then TRIPLE TAP YOUR INTERACT KEYBIND within 2 seconds\n - The interact keybind defaults to 'E' on PC\n - For consoles: interact defaults to 'Square' (PS5) or 'X' (X-Box)\n\nIf you have issues with this, ensure your interact keybind is set to 'tap', not 'hold':\nSettings > Controller > Infantry > Edit Settings > Infantry > Edit Control Settings > Other\n - Ensure that your \"Interact\" is set to \"Tap\".\n - If this STILL does not work for you, interact is immediately available on respawn only.\n\nThis dialog will continue to show...\n...until you successfully triple tap interact.",
        "mandatory2": "\nTip 2: This is round based Vehicular Combat:\n - 'Ready Up' to start the game. Don't leave the main base until countdown ends...\n - Everyone gets 1 life, and 1 vehicle only!\n - Rounds are 5 minutes long.\n - It's a \"Best of X\" format, you decide how many Rounds to play (Default: 3).\n - Map victory is decided by rounds won (e.g. if you win 2 out of 3 rounds).\n - On the last round, fight for the Objective if 1:00 remains on the Round clock.",
        "tip3": "Tip 3: Tie-Breaker Objective (H) is visible before Rounds:\n - This one Tie-Breaker Objective by default only appears in the LAST ROUND.\n - The objective unlocks with 1:00 remaining and becomes capturable.\n    - Capturing awards a Round win if both teams are still alive.\n - Vehicles are required to capture the Tie-Breaker Objective.\n - If the Round clock ends at 0:00, results with Tie-Breakers are:\n     1: More objective progress (indicated by progress bar and crown icon).\n     2: If equal objective progress: whoever has more kills.\n     3: If equal objective progress and kills are tied: Round Draw.",
        "tip4": "Tip 4: This experience supports 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 configurations!\n - Select the desired format while the 'Ready Up' screen is visible, (upper right corner).\n - Vehicles take a moment to spawn, so wait a moment while the mode changes.\n - If you go down in size (e.g. from '3v3' to '2v2') the extra vehicles will not respawn again.\n - Vehicles are curated for these maps, use what is provided!\n - Teams get mirror match-ups, the same vehicle types spawn for both teams.",
        "tip5": "Tip 5: We are limited by the inability to change vehicle loadouts mid-game:\n - Your loadout is locked once in-game; reconnect to choose a different vehicle loadout.\n - You can change your Engineer sub-class (Combat Engineer is optimal).\n - Vehicle performance and damage modeling is unchanged from vanilla BF6.",
        "tip6": "Tip 6: Positioning at the round start is up to the players:\n - The opening moments of a round are impactful!\n - Position intelligently at the start to flank, or setup ambushes.\n - If you cross the main base thresholds before countdown ends, return to the main base.",
        "tip7": "Tip 7: All gadgets except torch and supply crates are banned:\n - Despite what is selected, you will only get these two gadgets by design.\n - Leaving or entering your main base resupplies your vehicle ammo crates.\n - Ammo resupply boxes, if unused, will persist between rounds.",
        "tip8": "Tip 8: Vehicles marked 'abandoned' slowly take damage over time:\n - This experience is curated for Vehicles only, do not stray too far from them.\n - After 5m, if no players are within this range they are classified as 'abandoned'.\n - Abandoned Vehicles take damage slowly; they can be repaired back up if needed.\n - Vehicles destroyed by abandonment still award points during a live round.",
        "tip9": "Tip 9: The captain goes down with his ship:\n - Repairing your friends is allowed, as long as your vehicle is still standing.\n - If you lose your vehicle, please redeploy and let the round play out without you.\n - You can repair torch enemy vehicles but only as long as your own vehicle is still in play.",
        "tip10": "Tip 10: Vehicle Registration is required for scoring accuracy:\n - If you see no 'registration' message when entering a vehicle, get out and get back in.\n - If round results are innaccurate, you can address this with the admin panel.",
        "tip11": "Tip 11: Be a sportsman, not a dingus:\n - It is encouraged to set your chat to configure to display when there is activity.\n - Communicate with your opponent when you have bugs, issues, or need to pause.\n - Agreements made in chat should be binding: have fun and try different things.",
        "tip12": "Tip 12: This Experience is in active development! If bugs occur...\n - Access the Admin Panel in the top right while the 'Ready Up' screen is visible.\n - The Admin panel has global audit messaging and admin action counts.\n - Opening or using the Admin panel gives a global notification for all to see.\n - If any Admin buttons are used, the victory dialog shows this for awareness / visibility.\n - The Admin panel is for fixing innocent mistakes only (avoid using it unless necessary).",
        "tip13": "Tip 13: Many experience codes available for this game mode (ZMCYW: All 8 Maps)\n - ZMC3A: Area 22B\n - ZMC44: Blackwell Fields\n - ZMC52: Defense Nexus\n - ZMC5P: Golf Course\n - ZMC7Y: Liberation Peak\n - ZMC87: Mahattan Bridge\n - ZMC9S: Operation Firestorm\n - ZMC9Y: Mirak Valley",
        "tip14": "Tip 14: If extra vehicles remain in the main base from toggling down a mode.\n(e.g. going from 3v3 to 2v2)\n - It's best to blow these vehicles up before the round starts.\n - Anti-spawn camp detection protects against getting points\n - But this triggers only if they're destroyed during their origin.\n - Do not abuse this feature, that'd be a douchey thing to do.",
