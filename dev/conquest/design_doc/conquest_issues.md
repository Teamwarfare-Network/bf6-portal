## CQ_Bug_15
Title: Final-Minute Clock Can Disappear Instead Of Brief Flicker

Observed:
- Under `1:00`, the match clock can fully disappear before `00:00` instead of only briefly blinking.

Expected:
- The clock remains visible most of the time in the final minute, with only a short off-blip once per second.

Status:
- In Progress.

Latest Mitigation (v0.506):
- Removed `updateAllPlayersClock()` dependence on the per-player derived HUD clock cache and switched the clock renderer to the authoritative round-clock state.
- This removes one stale intermediate state layer from the final-minute visibility/color path.

Latest Mitigation (v0.507):
- Replaced modulo-phase clock flicker with an explicit once-per-second hide window so the final-minute flash cannot remain stuck hidden due to runtime timing drift.

Latest Mitigation (v0.508):
- Removed final-minute visibility flicker entirely and replaced it with a red/white text color pulse so the clock never hides between `1:00` and `00:00`.

Latest Mitigation (v0.509):
- Slowed the final-minute color pulse to one full color state per second so it reads in the same cadence as the second-boundary timer updates.

Latest Mitigation (v0.510):
- Removed elapsed-time-based pulse phasing and tied the final-minute red/white toggle directly to the displayed remaining second so the alert color stays visually consistent.

## CQ_Bug_14
Title: Engage HUD Stale After Player Death On Objective

Observed:
- When a player contests a flag and then dies, the custom engage UI can keep stale counts and/or active-objective ownership.
- Engine capture behavior continues correctly, but the custom engage HUD can lag behind the death state.

Expected:
- Dead/man-down players should be treated the same as leaving the objective for engage-count and active-popout ownership purposes.

Status:
- In Progress.

Latest Mitigation (v0.495):
- Added alive-only filtering for `GetPlayersOnPoint()` projection using soldier-state authority.
- Added subtick cleanup to clear engaged-objective ownership for dead/invalid/undeployed players even if exit callbacks lag.

## CQ_Bug_12
Title: Startup/Team-Swap HUD + Ready Dialog Latency

Observed:
- On first spawn and after team swap, combat HUD and Ready dialog can appear after a long delay.
- Ready dialog first open can visibly itemize through elements before becoming interactive.

Expected:
- HUD and Ready dialog should become responsive quickly and appear in one cohesive reveal.

Status:
- In Progress.

Latest Mitigation (v0.488-v0.489):
- Core runtime critical-ref validation reduced from every frame to periodic sampling to cut UI thread pressure.
- Core-mode legacy suppression changed to one-shot gating (not every forced refresh).
- Ready dialog first-build switched to hidden build then reveal-at-end to reduce itemized visual construction.
- Deferred join/deploy warm-cache prebuild restored so first real open can use cached dialog widgets instead of constructing live.

## CQ_Bug_13
Title: Intermittent Mid-Round Combat HUD Disappear

Observed:
- Combat tickets/flags lane can disappear briefly during live play.
- Repro reported both shortly after swap/capture activity and while stationary defending a flag.

Expected:
- Core combat HUD remains continuously visible when live and not swap-pending.

Status:
- In Progress.

Latest Mitigation (v0.491):
- Core runtime validation remains periodic but now advisory-only (no destructive recover on validation readback drift).
- Core fail-safe path no longer hides all combat HUD widgets on transient uncaught errors; it now resets scheduler cadence only.

## CQ_Bug_1
Title: Ticket Counter Overlay / Doubling During Bleed

Observed:
- Ticket values overlapped during bleed updates (multiple values rendered at once).

Expected:
- Exactly one ticket value per side, always.

Status:
- Fixed and re-verified multiple times in this session.
- Known regressions were resolved by tightening HUD ownership/render paths.

Resolution Used:
- Single-pass per-player HUD render gating to prevent duplicate writes in the same render window.
- Swap-pending guardrails to avoid duplicate rebuild/repaint paths creating stacked counters.
- Consolidated Conquest HUD ownership so one path writes ticket counters.

## CQ_Bug_2
Title: Residual 1px Flag Fill Sliver After Neutralization

Observed:
- After neutralizing and leaving a flag, a tiny fill sliver could remain in the flag square.

Expected:
- At true neutral, fill must be fully hidden.

Status:
- Fixed and re-verified in this session.

Resolution Used:
- Neutral-state clamping on fill geometry to hard-clear near-zero residual pixels.
- Neutral idle render path forces no-fill state even when samples jitter near zero.

## CQ_Bug_3
Title: Post-Team-Swap Engage HUD Logic Failure

Current Observed Behavior:
- First team behavior works.
- After team swap and spawn, first valid neutralization/capture entry can fail to show Engage HUD (`Neutralizing`/soldier diff bar), even while player is on a real objective.
- Multiple variants were seen during iteration (false positive at spawn, first-entry miss, delayed appearance), but current blocking variant is first valid objective entry not showing.
- Repro refinement:
  - If the player was actively contesting Flag A in the previous life, then swaps teams, the first later attempt to neutralize Flag A is where the bug reproduces.
  - If that same player instead goes to neutralize Flag B or Flag C first, the bug does not reproduce there.
  - The failure is tied to the first neutralization of the last actively contested objective from the previous life, not to the immediate post-swap window in general.

Expected:
- Engage HUD appears only when player is actively on a mapped capture point and participating in capture/neutralization conditions.
- Engage HUD never appears outside that condition.

Status:
- Open.
- Deferred to unblock progress.

What Was Tried (Detailed, With Outcomes):
- Attempt A: swap suppression + confirmation gating (`engageSwapClearRequiredByPid`, confirm ticks, candidate maps).
  - Goal: block stale post-swap engage rows.
  - Outcome: unstable flip-flop behavior (fixed one variant, regressed another): either false engage at/after spawn or first valid objective entry suppressed.
- Attempt B: area-trigger-informed gating (main-base state influence).
  - Goal: suppress engage while in base / right after swap.
  - Outcome: unreliable for engage authority. Area triggers are not objective-membership truth and introduced false timing dependencies (base trigger transitions could still align with incorrect engage visibility windows).
- Attempt C: sync-pass `GetPlayersOnPoint` ownership for engage binding.
  - Goal: make one polling owner for `engagedObjIdByPid`.
  - Outcome: still vulnerable to transient sampling/order issues around swap/deploy; stale or mismatched samples could either attach wrong state or miss first valid attach.
- Attempt D: mismatch filtering (`GetPlayersOnPoint` sampled team vs live team).
  - Goal: reject old-team stale echoes.
  - Outcome: reduced some false positives but also dropped valid first post-swap samples in some sequences.
- Attempt E: direct capture-point event ownership (`OnPlayerEnterCapturePoint` / `OnPlayerExitCapturePoint`).
  - Goal: bind engage only from direct capture-point enter/exit APIs.
  - Outcome: improved signal quality but still not fully resolved in final repro due remaining lifecycle/order interactions with swap/deploy/render gating.
- Attempt F: deploy/swap clear-path adjustments (remove deploy-time clears, relax/adjust pending guards).
  - Goal: preserve first valid post-swap objective bind.
  - Outcome: did not fully resolve the repro; first post-swap neutralization can still fail to render engage panel.
- Attempt G: soldier count source hardening (live team preference, remove deployed-map filter in count path).
  - Goal: prevent engage hide due to transient zero friendly count.
  - Outcome: no durable fix for this specific repro.

Area Trigger Note (Important):
- Area triggers (`OnPlayerEnterAreaTrigger` / `OnPlayerExitAreaTrigger`) are valid for main-base/ready gating, but proved unreliable for engage ownership.
- Engage ownership must remain capture-point authoritative; area-trigger state should not be used as the primary source for engage show/hide decisions.

APIs / Signals Currently Used (Latest State):
- Engage ownership intent:
  - `OnPlayerEnterCapturePoint(eventPlayer, eventCapturePoint)`
  - `OnPlayerExitCapturePoint(eventPlayer, eventCapturePoint)`
  - Runtime map: `State.conquest.capture.engagedObjIdByPid`
- Capture state + soldier differential inputs:
  - `mod.GetPlayersOnPoint(capturePoint)` (counts only; not intended as primary engage-owner signal)
  - `mod.GetCurrentOwnerTeam(capturePoint)`
  - `mod.GetOwnerProgressTeam(capturePoint)`
  - `mod.GetCaptureProgress(capturePoint)`
  - `OngoingCapturePoint`, `OnCapturePointLost`, `OnCapturePointCaptured`
- Swap lifecycle controls involved in suppression/hide windows:
  - `State.conquest.debug.teamSwapHudResetPendingByPid`
  - `OnPlayerDeployed` release path
  - swap action path using `mod.SetTeam(...)` + forced undeploy/redeploy flow

Working Hypothesis (Updated):
- This now looks less like a general post-swap timing failure and more like stale objective-specific engage state surviving across death/team-switch boundaries.
- The likely missing cleanup is for "last contested objective by this player" when the player changes team without receiving a fully authoritative objective-leave path for that prior-life objective.
- Future fix attempt should explicitly test/clear engaged-objective state on team switch itself, not only on deploy/undeploy/death and capture-point enter/exit.

Why Deferred:
- Despite repeated targeted changes, final repro remains: after team swap, first valid neutralization can still fail to show engage panel.
- Further attempts without instrumentation risk repeating regressions.

Recommended Next Pass (When Resumed):
- Add minimal internal transition tracing for one player across:
  - capture-point enter/exit callbacks
  - `engagedObjIdByPid`
  - `teamSwapHudResetPendingByPid`
  - player team value before/after swap
  - engage view-model visibility decision
- Add objective-specific tracing for "last contested objective before death/swap" versus "first objective entered after swap".
- Freeze one authoritative engage state machine and remove any remaining parallel eligibility checks.
- Validate with strict scripted test sequence focused on:
  - contest Flag A -> die or swap -> neutralize Flag A first
  - contest Flag A -> die or swap -> neutralize Flag B first

## CQ_Bug_4
Title: Team Swap HUD Rebuild Visibly Incremental

Observed:
- HUD could appear element-by-element after swap.

Expected:
- Swap redraw should appear as a cohesive state.

Status:
- Fixed enough for current phase based on latest user validation.

Resolution Used:
- Non-destructive swap reset/hide flow.
- Delayed authoritative redraw with pending gating to reduce visible incremental construction.

## CQ_Bug_5
Title: Team Swap Crash

Observed:
- Swap-time crash introduced during heavy HUD iteration.

Expected:
- No crash on team swap under any live HUD state.

Status:
- Fixed.

Resolution Used:
- Simplified swap HUD lifecycle and removed unstable overlapping refresh behavior.
- Hardened swap cleanup ordering to avoid conflicting redraw/update paths.

## CQ_Bug_6
Title: Ticket Bleed Chevrons Not Visible

Observed:
- Chevrons missing or hidden until later lifecycle events.

Expected:
- Chevrons visible immediately when bleed differential applies.

Status:
- Fixed in latest user validation.

Resolution Used:
- Enforced render/layer order and swap lifecycle hide/recovery behavior.
- Stabilized first-life visibility and rebuild ordering for chevron refs.

## CQ_Bug_7
Title: Top Row Flag Border Persists While Pop-Out Is Visible

Observed:
- During active objective pop-out display, top-row flag border color can remain visible.

Expected:
- When pop-out is visible, there should be no top-row border on the active slot.
- Active objective status should be represented by the pop-out only.

Status:
- Resolved in latest user validation.

Potential Resolution Drivers:
- Active top-row slot neutralization when `engagedObjIdByPid` matches slot objective (border/fill/label/percent hidden on active slot projection).
- Active-slot border suppression in slot renderer (`suppressActiveBorder`) so the engaged top-row slot cannot render a border while pop-out is active.
- Force-hide hardening for top-row/pop-out/engage with cache rebind via name fallback (`safeFind`) to prevent stale border refs surviving swap/rebuild paths.

## CQ_Bug_8
Title: Intermittent Flag Differential Stall During Neutralization/Recapture Transition

Observed:
- In some neutralization/recapture transition windows, objective ownership differential can present as stale for bleed/chevron projection.
- Repro observed where enemy held only one objective while other previously-owned objectives were neutralized, but bleed/chevron did not immediately reflect differential.
- Behavior sometimes self-corrected after subsequent capture interaction.

Expected:
- Differential, bleed, and chevrons should update coherently at neutralization/recapture edges without requiring additional interaction.

Status:
- Resolved in latest user validation (keep monitoring for recurrence during high-transition rounds).

Potential Resolution Drivers:
- Differential ownership counting remains capture-state authoritative (`capture.byObjId.ownerTeam`).
- Authoritative owner resolver now includes pre-event edge inference for strong neutralization/recapture thresholds when edge callbacks are missed, so owner differential cannot stall until a later interaction.

## CQ_Bug_9
Title: Cross-Player HUD Clash / Double Draw

Observed:
- In multiplayer sessions, HUD elements can redraw/clash across players.
- Some HUD lanes appear to behave like shared/global UI instead of strict per-player ownership.
- Aspect-ratio alignment issues became harder to isolate due to mixed HUD ownership and repeated root rewrites.

Expected:
- Every Conquest HUD widget is unique per player and PID-scoped.
- No gameplay HUD widget is shared globally across players.
- Top combat HUD uses one deterministic centered root chain across aspect ratios.

Status:
- Open.

Scope/Intent:
- Align Conquest HUD lifecycle to Helis pattern:
  1. Frequent HUD widgets are pre-created once per player and toggled.
  2. Rare/ephemeral widgets are create-on-demand + delete-on-close.
  3. Team switch is hide-first, clean rebuild, then resume updates.

Current Workstream:
- Simplification pass started to remove competing runtime layout owners and reduce HUD migration churn in live tick paths.
- Positioning pass (v0.429): added a dedicated hud-core top-stack Y offset so tickets/flags/progress bars render below the match clock lane while pop-out/engage preserve relative ordering.
- Positioning refinement (v0.430): increased hud-core top-stack offset and normalized ticket counter/slash row Y alignment to improve bar/counter lane cohesion.
- Parity refinement (v0.432): core ticket leader team now resolves from live ticket state (restores lead border/crown visibility in core mode), engage count chips now render with dark background fill, and core chevrons are static-visible (no pulse-hide index).
- Positioning refinement (v0.433): moved ticket counter row down toward bar lane, tied crown Y to counter row, and lowered pop-out lane (engage remains chained beneath pop-out).
- Added cached-root PID ownership guardrails in HUD bootstrap to prevent stale/shared ref collisions from surviving cache reuse.
- Removed schema-coupled live HUD bootstrap checks from the Conquest tick loop; HUD bootstrap is now cache/critical-ref driven.
- Added strict PID ownership validation for critical HUD refs before render, forcing per-player rebuild on ownership mismatch.
- Removed cached-path per-refresh layout rewrite calls (legacy purge/reposition churn) so HUD roots stay in their authored centered positions.
- Restored teardown root contract: `TopHudRoot_{pid} -> ConquestCombatHudRoot_{pid} -> ConquestTicketsHudRoot_{pid}/ConquestFlagsHudRoot_{pid}`.
- Removed render-loop layout revision rebuild logic; rebuild authority is back to `ensureHudForPlayer()` lifecycle ownership only.
- Tightened critical-ref parent validation to named parent-chain checks (combat root under top root; ticket/flag roots under combat root).
- Regression check pending in-game: confirm ready-dialog open path and triple-tap interact flow after the root-chain rebuild pass.
- End-to-end trace finding: startup + live loop + capture-event forced refresh all route through `ensureHudForPlayer()`; root placement failure was in build path silently returning refs even when pinning failed.
- Hardening applied: `ParseUI` return handles are now used for TopHud/Combat root creation; combat root pin success is now mandatory before returning refs.
- Visual leak guard applied: combat tickets/flags roots now build hidden and are only revealed by render owner after successful ensure.
- Additional root-cause refinement: duplicate-name `TopHudRoot_{pid}` instances could survive and still satisfy name-based parent checks, producing intermittent top-left/flicker behavior.
- Additional hardening applied: `ensureTopHudRootForPid()` now performs one-time per-runtime duplicate purge for `TopHudRoot_{pid}` before creation, and combat-root chain validation now requires direct parent-handle identity (not name-only checks).
- Hot-path root drift found in render owner: ticket counter renderer was still resolving by `safeFind(...)` and reparenting core counter widgets during normal updates, which could override build-time parent ownership.
- Hot-path hardening applied: ticket counter renderer is now refs-only for core counter widgets (no runtime parent rebinding), and critical-ref validation in `capture-tickets.ts` now enforces parent-handle identity for `TopHudRoot -> CombatRoot -> Tickets/Flags`.
- Cached-root drift found in ensure lifecycle: cached combat roots were still being rehydrated by name (`safeFind`) in `hud-build.ts`, allowing wrong duplicate handle selection despite valid cache objects.
- Lifecycle hardening applied: cache path now requires authoritative cached root handles (`topHudRoot`, `conquestCombatRoot`, tickets root, flags root) and no longer hydrates core roots by name; invalid/missing handles force a teardown rebuild.
- Combat-root duplicate hardening applied: `ConquestCombatHudRoot_{pid}` now gets one-time duplicate-name purge before first ensure per PID, with init-token reset on hard reset/leave cleanup.
- Critical-ref geometry hole found: live critical checks could still pass a top-left chain when parent handles were correct but anchors/positions were wrong.
- Geometry gate applied: critical checks now require centered anchor+position for `TopHudRoot`, `ConquestCombatHudRoot`, `ConquestTicketsHudRoot`, and `ConquestFlagsHudRoot`; failing geometry now forces teardown rebuild before render.
- Root-subtree ref drift found: global name lookups (`safeFind`) could still bind gameplay refs to off-root same-name widgets even when the centered root chain was valid.
- Ref-owner hardening applied: after centered root pin, gameplay refs are now rebound via subtree-scoped lookup (`FindUIWidgetWithName(name, ticketsRoot/flagsRoot)`) so runtime paths cannot target off-root duplicates.
- Critical-ref ownership expanded: validation now requires ticket container/bar parent contracts and flag slot/engage/popout parent contracts, forcing immediate teardown rebuild on any off-root handle selection.
- Latest regression evidence (2026-03-11):
  - `reference_design_documentation/testing_images/current_testing2.PNG` shows top combat lane collapse/off-center behavior after enabling combat owner `v2`, while ready/triple-tap flows remain functional.
- Code-trace findings (2026-03-11):
  - `src/config/conquest-constants.ts` now sets `CONQUEST_COMBAT_RENDER_OWNER = "v2"`.
  - `src/index/capture-tickets.ts` returns early to the v2 owner path and bypasses legacy combat-lane critical-ref geometry validation.
  - `src/ui/conquest/combat-v2/render.ts` critical-ref gate currently checks handle presence only (no parent-chain/anchor/position validation).
  - `src/ui/conquest/combat-v2/build.ts` uses `safeFind(name)` first and does not perform duplicate-name purge or subtree ownership validation before reuse.
  - `src/ui/conquest/combat-v2/lifecycle.ts` `resetAllConquestCombatHudV2()` only destroys entries present in v2 cache; stale same-name widgets can survive when runtime/cache state is reset by crash/reload.
- Immediate containment plan:
  1. Add v2 root-chain validation (parent handle + anchor + position geometry) and fail-close rebuild.
  2. Add one-time duplicate purge for v2 root chain per PID before first ensure.
  3. Add startup hard-purge of v2 widget names for active players before first v2 render pass.
- Additional regression evidence (2026-03-11):
  - `reference_design_documentation/testing_images/current_testing3.PNG` still shows legacy-style left-aligned combat lane fragments while centered v2 lane is expected.
- Additional root-cause finding (2026-03-11):
  - `src/ui/conquest/hud-build.ts` still built legacy combat roots/widgets during `ensureHudForPlayer()` even when combat owner was `v2` (`combatHudEnabled === false`).
  - This allowed legacy combat artifacts to survive/render in mixed-owner sessions and visually mask v2 ownership behavior.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-11):
  - Legacy combat build block in `ensureHudForPlayer()` is now gated by `combatHudEnabled`; when owner is `v2`, legacy combat roots are not built and only non-combat HUD lanes remain.
- Architecture cutover requirement (2026-03-11):
  - Mixed-owner regressions confirm containment patches are insufficient as a long-term strategy.
  - Hard-cut replacement plan is now authored in `design_doc/UI_flow_new_v2.md` with:
    - all-new `twlConquestHud*` function namespace,
    - all-new `TwlConquestHud_*` widget naming contract,
    - runtime mode toggle (`off` / `legacy` / `core`),
    - explicit ban on legacy combat function/name reuse in `core` mode.
- Hard-cut implementation kickoff (2026-03-11):
  - Added new isolated combat HUD pipeline under `src/ui/conquest/hud-core/*` with all-new names (`TwlConquestHud_*`) and all-new function chain (`twlConquestHud*`).
  - Added runtime mode gate in `src/config/conquest-constants.ts` (`getConquestHudMode/setConquestHudMode`, default `core`) and routed combat update owner to new pipeline when mode is `core`.
  - Legacy combat build path in `ensureHudForPlayer()` now only builds when mode is `legacy`.
  - Immediate validation target: verify centered placement of `TwlConquestHud` ticket/objective lanes before expanding feature parity.
- Additional runtime-coupling finding (2026-03-11):
  - HUD-core forced tick could throw during startup/live HUD refresh and abort upstream mode flow, which can prevent vehicle spawner startup and core match-loop continuity.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-11):
  - Added HUD-core fail-safe guards to auto-disable HUD-core mode (`off`) on runtime fault without terminating gameplay loops.
  - Moved vehicle-spawner backend startup earlier in `onGameModeStartedImpl` so vehicle systems are not blocked by optional HUD warmup.
- Root-cause isolated (2026-03-11):
  - New combat HUD paths (`hud-core` and `combat-v2`) referenced `mod.stringkeys.twl.hud.clock.slash`, but slash is defined at `mod.stringkeys.twl.system.slash` in `src/strings.json`.
  - This key mismatch can fault ticket-lane slash label writes and trigger fail-safe mode-off behavior (no combat HUD visible).
- Fix applied (2026-03-11):
  - Replaced slash key usage with `mod.stringkeys.twl.system.slash` in new combat HUD build/render paths.
  - Reset `State.conquest.debug.hudModeOverride` during startup scaffold so prior fail-safe `off` latches do not persist across restarts.
- Runtime-visibility hardening (2026-03-11):
  - In `hud-core` tick, strict ref validation is now advisory (single cold-start recovery attempt, then fail-open render) to prevent a false-negative validator from suppressing all combat HUD visibility.
- Additional no-HUD regression finding (2026-03-11):
  - `hud-core` had hard fail-close behavior in startup/live catches that set `hudModeOverride` to `"off"` on any uncaught exception; a single transient fault could leave combat HUD permanently hidden for the session.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-11):
  - Converted HUD-core fail handling to soft-fail (hide/reset only, do not auto-switch mode to `"off"`), so core can recover on subsequent ticks.
  - Reduced HUD-core palette dependency risk by sourcing vectors from existing `CONQUEST_HUD_*_RGB`/shared HUD constants in `ui-layout`, avoiding extra cross-module vector alias coupling.
- Additional root-acquisition finding (2026-03-12):
  - `hud-core` root build path depends on `ensureTopHudRootForPid(...)`; strict post-normalization parent-handle identity checks in that helper could return `undefined` even when UI was otherwise valid, suppressing all core combat HUD creation.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Relaxed `ensureTopHudRootForPid(...)` post-normalization verification to best-effort (anchor/position correction without fatal parent-handle identity rejection).
  - Added `TopHudRoot_{pid}` name-fallback resolution in `hud-core/build.ts` before aborting root creation.
- Additional visual-parity finding (2026-03-12):
  - New `hud-core` surfaces were created as `bgFill: None`, and several visual lanes retained zero background alpha, which produced text-only rendering (ticket numbers/labels visible while bars/slot/panel surfaces looked missing).
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Applied explicit `Solid` fill + authored alpha to `hud-core` ticket bars, objective slot/fill surfaces, active-popout slot/fill surfaces, and engage track/fill surfaces.
- Additional parity + flicker finding (2026-03-12):
  - `hud-core` ticket lane spacing had drifted from the legacy geometry contract (simplified fixed X positions), and live capture-state sampling was second-boundary driven, producing synchronized engage/count strobing with the clock cadence.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Restored legacy ticket/center-gap spacing formulas in `hud-core` constants for parity with the prior approved HUD look.
  - Moved live capture-state sync onto the sub-second main loop cadence so dynamic engage/count data updates no longer pulse only on second boundaries.
- Additional flicker root-cause refinement (2026-03-12):
  - `hud-core` runtime fail-safe hid all combat widgets globally when any single per-player frame update faulted, which could present as periodic full-lane blinking.
  - Engine-sync pass zeroed per-objective on-point counts before each sample; transient `GetCapturePoint` misses could briefly drive engage counts to zero and then restore on the next sample.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Converted `hud-core` runtime fault handling to per-player recovery first, with scheduler-only soft reset on outer faults (no global hide pulse).
  - Added on-point sample grace in capture sync: retain last counts through short engine-miss windows and clear only after sustained staleness.
- Additional startup-blocker finding (2026-03-12):
  - `detectMapKeyFromHqs()` executed raw `mod.GetHQ`/`mod.GetObjectPosition`/distance checks at startup with no fail-open guard.
  - If HQ objects were not queryable yet on startup frame timing, `onGameModeStartedImpl` could abort before logic loops and spawner startup, presenting as a full experience no-load.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Hardened `detectMapKeyFromHqs()` to fail-open (`undefined`) when HQ probe/distance checks are unavailable, so startup continues with default map config instead of hard-aborting boot.
- Isolation step applied (2026-03-12):
  - Rolled back the three `v0.423` core HUD runtime experiments (per-player pipeline fault-isolation variant, on-point sample grace, and label fallback tweak) to reduce variables while validating startup no-load behavior.
- Additional visual-correction pass (2026-03-12):
  - Core ticket bars were using friendly-vs-enemy split ratio, which rendered start-state bars as half full.
  - Core ticket lane spacing was keyed to a forced fallback objective count rather than configured objective count.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Restored ticket bar fill ratio to legacy intent (`current team tickets / CONQUEST_STARTING_TICKETS`).
  - Aligned ticket spacing calculation to configured objective count (no forced fallback slot count).
- Additional timing/appearance pass (2026-03-12):
  - Core popout/engage lanes now use atomic first-frame reveal sequencing (root visible last after child state writes) to prevent staged widget appearance.
  - Core chevron rendering now refreshes label/color/alpha each frame and includes dedicated shadow-layer widgets with explicit lifecycle cleanup.
- Additional layout/flicker refinement (2026-03-12):
  - Core ticket/objective spacing inputs were still resolved as module-load constants; when objective mapping/config finalized later, built widget X positions could remain on stale spacing and hide expected top-row slots.
  - Objective labels in core snapshot defaulted to `?` when derived label messages were transiently unavailable, and transient snapshot-build faults could force visible fallback oscillation.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - Replaced static ticket-lane X constants with runtime layout resolution keyed to live mapped/configured objective count and added per-player layout-count rebuild trigger.
  - Added deterministic objective-letter fallback by objective id/row and last-good snapshot reuse on transient snapshot-build faults.
- Additional pulsing/label regression finding (2026-03-12):
  - `hud-core` ensure/build path still executed every tick and reapplied default text values (`?`, `0`) before render ownership updated real values, causing visible pulse/flicker under live cadence.
  - Fallback objective label path used literal letters via `mod.Message("A")` style calls, which can resolve as unknown and show `?`.
- Mitigation applied (2026-03-12):
  - `hud-core` build path now short-circuits when initialized and layout signature is unchanged; render remains value owner.
  - `hud-core` text ensure writes defaults only on first widget creation, preventing per-tick default-value stomps.
  - Fallback objective/popout labels now map to explicit localized flag-letter string keys (`STR_HUD_CONQUEST_FLAG_LETTER_*`).

## CQ_Bug_10
Title: Combat HUD Drop-Shadow Parity Missing (Core Path)

Observed:
- Core combat HUD text currently lacks legacy-style drop-shadow layering on key combat text surfaces.

Expected:
- Legacy-equivalent drop-shadow treatment restored for combat HUD text groups.

Status:
- In progress.

Sequencing Contract:
1. First lock approved parity for positioning, sizing, and color.
2. Only after that lock, run a dedicated drop-shadow restoration pass.
3. Validate shadow offsets/layering after geometry/color lock so they are not invalidated by later layout changes.

Latest Progress (v0.438):
- Added core HUD text shadow widgets and per-frame shadow label/color updates for:
  - ticket counters,
  - objective labels/percent rows,
  - active popout label/percent rows,
  - engage counts/status row.
- Further parity tuning may still be needed after live screenshot validation.

Latest Progress (v0.440):
- Restored differential bleed-chevron visibility in core path (no static all-7 fallback).
- Added reusable shadow-ring profile builder in `hud-core` constants and applied it to:
  - bleed chevrons (legacy-style up-bias profile),
  - objective percent chips,
  - popout percent chip.
- Nudged core engage lane upward slightly and moved objective percent chip row up for tighter visual attachment to top flag squares.

Latest Progress (v0.441):
- Hardened shadow-ring render/hide paths with null-safe array access so stale in-memory entries cannot throw and suppress lane visibility.

Title: Help Text Reappears After Team Swap During Live Match

Observed:
- After swapping teams while match is already live, top-center help text can reappear.

Expected:
- Help text must remain hidden while match is live.
- Help text should only follow pre-live ready/not-ready visibility rules.

Status:
- Resolved in `v0.434`.

Resolution Used:
- Changed top-center help container default creation visibility to hidden.
- Removed early return in pid visibility refresh when HUD refs are temporarily missing; fallback name lookup now still applies authoritative visibility.
- Added post-ensure visibility reapply on deploy so newly rebuilt widgets cannot keep default state after swap.
