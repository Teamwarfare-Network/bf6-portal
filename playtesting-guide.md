## Gearing Up (Pre-Combat)

### Team Swapping
If you need to swap teams:
1. Bring up the Ready Screen (triple tap interact)
2. Select Change Teams
3. Respawn after delay

### Vehicle Registration (CRITICAL)

> ⚠️ **You MUST receive the "Vehicle Registered" message when entering your vehicle!**

- If you don't see the message, **get out and get back in**
- **Best practice**: Enter your vehicle twice to ensure registration
- Registration messages are global — both teams can visually confirm

### Ready Up
1. Stay in your main base
2. Use "Ready Up" screen when prepared
3. Wait for both teams to ready up
4. Countdown confirms when round is live — only then leave main base

---

## Active Combat

### During the Round
- **Do not return to main base** after leaving (until combat ends)
- Only **registered vehicles** that are destroyed count toward score
- You receive **2 supply crates** when leaving main base
- **Repair** your tank with the Engineer torch during combat
- **Stay close to your tank** — the abandonment range is small
- Straying too far = tank explodes = enemy point

### If Your Tank is Destroyed
- You are out for the round
- Return to main base OR do not redeploy
- Do not impact the outcome

### If You Die (But Tank Survives)
- Select redeploy
- Return to main base
- Do not continue fighting

### Team Repairs (2v2+)
- You can repair friendly tanks if close enough

---

## End of Combat Round

1. **Respawn back in your main base**
2. **Repair and resupply** at main base if needed
3. **Confirm score in chat if Victory screen is wrong**: e.g., "Round 2 score: 3 West, 1 East"
4. Ready up for next round

> ⚠️ Losing a registered tank at ANY time during a Live round counts as a point for the enemy

---

## Known Issues

1. **Cannot edit vehicle configuration on entry** — Portal limitation
2. **Spawn issues**: If you can't spawn, check your Engineer loadout
3. **Vehicle registration intermittent**: First entry sometimes doesn't register. Second entry always works.

## Dispute Resolution

- **Screenshots**: Take screenshots of chat, victory screens and combat for disputes
- **Chat agreements**: All agreements in chat are binding
- **Score confirmation**: Good habit to confirm scores in chat between rounds
