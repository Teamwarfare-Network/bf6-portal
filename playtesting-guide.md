## Before Round Begins

### Setup
1. **Enable Chat Visibility**: Find the Chat Visibility option and cycle through until it says "Show" or "Always On" — this allows cross-team communication
2. **Declare Home Team**: Usually whoever is hosting the server
3. **Confirm Format in Chat**: Both teams must agree on the format (all chat agreements are binding)

### Format Examples

| Format | Vehicle Composition |
|--------|---------------------|
| 1v1 Tanks | 1 tank of your choice |
| 2v2 Tanks | 1 MBT + 1 IFV |
| 3v3 Tanks | 1 MBT + 1 IFV + 1 other |
| 4v4 Tanks | 1 MBT + 1 IFV + 2 others |
| 5v5 Tanks | 1 MBT + 1 IFV + 3 others |
| 6v6 Tanks | 1 MBT + 1 IFV + 4 others |

## Gearing Up (Pre-Combat)

### Team Swapping
If you need to swap teams:
1. Select the enemy main base spawn point
2. Wait for team swap to complete
3. Respawn after delay

### Vehicle Registration (CRITICAL)

> ⚠️ **You MUST receive the "Vehicle Registered" message when entering your vehicle!**

- If you don't see the message, **get out and get back in**
- **Best practice**: Enter your vehicle twice to ensure registration
- Registration messages are global — both teams can visually confirm

### Ready Up
1. Stay in your main base
2. Type "Ready" in chat when prepared
3. Wait for both teams to confirm ready
4. One team types "Go" — only then leave main base

---

## Active Combat

### During the Round
- **Do not return to main base** after leaving (until combat ends)
- Only **registered vehicles** that are destroyed count toward score
- You receive **2 supply crates** when leaving main base
- **Repair** your tank with the Engineer torch during combat
- **Stay close to your tank** — the abandonment range is small
- Straying too far = tank explodes = enemy point

### If Your Tank is Destroyed
- You are out for the round
- Return to main base OR do not redeploy
- Do not impact the outcome

### If You Die (But Tank Survives)
- Select redeploy
- Return to main base
- Do not continue fighting

### Team Repairs (2v2+)
- You can repair friendly tanks if close enough

---

## End of Combat Round

1. **Drive back** to main base (don't abandon your tank)
2. **Repair and resupply** at main base
3. **Vehicle swap**: Return current tank to its spawn point before taking a new one
4. **Confirm score in chat**: e.g., "Round 2 score: 3 West, 1 East"
5. Ready up for next round

> ⚠️ Losing a registered tank at ANY time counts as a point for the enemy

## Known Issues

1. **Cannot edit vehicle configuration on entry** — Portal limitation
2. **Spawn issues**: If you can't spawn, check your Engineer loadout (only Supply Crate and EOD Bot available as gadgets; EOD Bot is a workaround but don't use it in combat)
3. **Vehicle registration intermittent**: First entry sometimes doesn't register. Second entry always works.
